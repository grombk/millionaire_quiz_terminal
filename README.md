# Gameplay
The game asks you for your name. Input your name and you will progress through the rounds of the quiz. If you answer 11 questions correctly, you win Â£1,000,000! 
There are 3 lifelines give to you to help answer questions:

1) 50/50 - This lifeline removes two incorrent answers and presents you with the correct answer and a random wrong one
2) Ask an Audience - This lifeline automatically generates confidence responses for each answer
3) Skip Question - This skips the current question and moves you on to the next question

Good luck!
